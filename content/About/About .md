**About Me: Rihaan B H**

Hello! I'm Rihaan B H, and I'm thrilled to share a glimpse of who I am and what my interests are :

**ü§ñ Robotics and AI Enthusiast**
I am a student at S1 Robotics and AI, where I am constantly exploring the exciting realms of robotics and artificial intelligence. My enthusiasm for creating intelligent systems that interact with and understand the world around us is what propels me forward. Whether it's programming intricate algorithms or designing innovative robotic solutions, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible.

**üêç I like programming**
The first language i learnt was python, I started learning programming during the covid lockdown, Although i'm not that good at comepetitive programming i like building games using pygame, make cv apps using open cv and other stuff 

**Computer Vision**
I came accross a competition on youtube called f1tenth and i started reading more about it and i read a few of the research papers over there one of which was something related to reducing number of sensors in autonomous vehicles by training an ai model which can do depth preception just by using a camera i would like to make something like that in the future

**Arduino and robots**
During covid i was gifted an arduino kit since then i've been playing with it making small line follower robots, humidity and temp detection , playing with led mattrix and other little projects.

**‚öΩ Sports Enthusiast**
Beyond the world of technology, I'm an avid sports enthusiast. Swimming and football are my go-to activities for staying active and recharging my mind. 

**All in all i want to learn new things and in the end I want to make my own contribution in the field of tech within my lifetime which should help people**
